//This will automatically turn thread into cloth once manually selected loom.
//Run macro, select Loom once when prompted then let it work for you!
//Features : auto stop when above set weight, auto stop when no more material.
//Tested and working on MobileUO 06.05.2024, coded by Joka.
//Note : graphic ID for loom doesn't seem to accept target, so had to request manually selecting loom then using 'autotargetlast' later to auto loop.

//select loom
